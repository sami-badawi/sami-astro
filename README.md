# Mini Static Blog Site for Sami Badawi

My current static blog site [http://samibadawi.com](http://samibadawi.com) is generated with Hugo and hosted on GCP. It was focused on responsive web design. But it is pretty clumbsy to work with.

Testing out modern static site generators: Deno Lume and Astro. 

This is a test site for Astro. 


# Built with Astro Starter Kit: Blog

```
npm create astro@latest -- --template blog
```
